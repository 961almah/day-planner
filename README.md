# DAY PLANNER

This Day Planner is an app designed to help the user organize their day.

It is supported with a live clock that provides time and date, and for maximum efficiency and user-attention, it goes by color.

## Installation

Simply go to the [website](https://961almah.github.io/day-planner/) to access the application.
To access Code, please visit (https://github.com/961almah/day-planner/).

## Usage

User would input the data (for example, his plans for the day) into the empty blocks, each of which having the time to the left of it, and hit save. The input will be saved until the user removes it manually.

As time passes, the blocks will change color from Green, meaning that X hour remains in the future, and Grey, meaning that Y hour is now past us.

This will help the user tell whether he has passed the designated time of his task.
